<h1>Facebook Engagement</h1>
<h2>Walmart, Microsoft, IBM, Johnson & Johnson, <br \>and GE Facebook Pages</h2>
<p>March 18, 2014</p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The Facebook platform provides a myriad of ways for companies to engage with consumers.  This study provides a framework, using a variety of metrics, for reviewing how companies engage with consumers via Facebook.  
The level of activity on the Facebook pages of Microsoft, Walmart, IBM, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), and GE are used as examples.  The data was collected 
from these companies' primary Facebook pages for the January 2013 - January 2014 time period.  Not all Facebook pages for these companies and their products 
were included but these primary pages provide a general sense of the overall level of Facebook engagement.  <em>(See below for more detail on page selection 
criteria.)</em>  Walmart has Facebook pages for the Walmart brand and its Sam's Club stores.  In addition there are pages for individual store locations.  
A small sample of store pages was included in this analysis just to get a sense of the Facebook engagement at a local level.</p>

<p>The data set used in this study was collected free of charge via Facebook's API.  Not all data available to the companies is available to the public.
But there is enough data publicly available to be able to gauge how well a company is engaging with the consumer.  One could guess that a company
that has a well organized and executed approach to its Facebook pages would also have a certain level of sophistication in its Facebook use overall.</p>    

<p>An assessment of Facebook activity has three components:<ul><li>Pages</li><li>Posts on pages</li><li>Social network analysis</li></ul> The pages component looks at how many Facebook
pages a company has and the popularity of those pages as measured by "likes" and "people talking about this (PTAT)".  The number of page views is not
a publicly available figure.  The number of posts
per page shows the level of page activity.  The metrics for measuring the popularity of posts are: the number of "likes", the number of times a post has 
been shared, and the number of comments a post generates.  Posts are also an excellent source of information about consumer attitudes towards a company or brand.  
The Facebook API contains comments that are not shown on the Facebook page.  In a separate post I'll explore the content of these comments.  
Network analysis recognizes that not all user internactions carry equal weight.   Companies want 
their Facebook interactions to occur with a wide variety of people, not just the same people.  They also want to interact with a variety of clusters of 
people as well as Facebook users who have a deep social media following.  Network analysis is beyond the scope of this study, 
but definitely worth addressing.</p>   
 
<h3>Page Popularity - "Likes"</h3>
<p>Walmart, Skype, Xbox,  and Windows have the largest number of "likes", followed by Internet Explorer, Microsoft, Bing, Window's Phone, and Sam's Club.</p>
<a href="http://www.digitaltrendanalytics.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/LikespPage.jpeg"><img class="displayed" src="http://www.digitaltrendanalytics.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/LikespPage.jpeg" width="710" height="550" /></a>
<p>The number of "likes" on a page typically changes day to day.  Therefore we can observe the rate of increase in 'likes' for various pages.  Taking a sample of pages--Walmart, 
Xbox, Microsoft, Johnson's Baby, and GE Appliances--the number of 'likes' during the Feb 2013-March 2014 time period can be seen below.
<a href="http://www.digitaltrendanalytics.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Likes2013.jpeg"><img class="displayed" src="http://www.digitaltrendanalytics.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Likes2013.jpeg" width="710" height="375" /></a>
<p>The scaling of the chart above makes it difficult to grasp the percentage change in "likes" for each page over this time period.  The percentage changes are:</p>
<ul><li>Walmart 71%</li>
<li>Xbox 31%</li>
<li>Microsoft 113% </li>
<li>Johnson's Baby 17% </li>
<li>GE Appliances 14%</li></ul> 


<h3>Page Popularity - "People Talking About This (PTAT)"</h3>
<p>According to Facebook, the PTAT metric is designed to show the actual number of unique people who are 'engaged' and interacting with a Facebook Page
during the prior 7 days. A PTAT point comes from people making comments, liking a post, sharing, accepting a promotional offer, etc. Since the metric 
represents only activity from the last 7 days, it is considered a more up to date metric of activity.</p>
<a href="http://www.digitaltrendanalytics.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/PTATpPage.jpeg"><img class="displayed" src="http://www.digitaltrendanalytics.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/PTATpPage.jpeg" width="710" height="550" /></a>
<p> PTATs are best followed over time because bursts or clusters of activity are more common than a constant activity level. Using the same sample of 
pages--Walmart, Xbox, Microsoft, Johnson's Baby, and GE Appliances--the daily count of PTATs is shown below.</p>
<a href="http://www.digitaltrendanalytics.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/PTAT20131.jpeg"><img class="displayed" src="http://www.digitaltrendanalytics.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/PTAT20131.jpeg" width="710" height="375" /></a>
<p>The Walmart data looks particularly strange.  There is a rapid drop in PTAT in October, just when the company would be advertising for
holiday sales.  The spikes in Xbox PTATs occur around the dates of the E3 convention and around the release of the new Xbox console.   
<p>The ratio of PTAT to "likes" is a common metric used to assess how current the page activity is relative to all the people who like the page.  While this ratio 
penalizes companies that have developed a lot of "likes" over time and favors newer pages with lots of activity, it is still useful.  Like PTATs, this ratio, 
is best followed over time.</p>
<p>As a rule of thumb, a PTAT to "likes" ratio above 5% is good. For the particular point in time, the ratios for Walmart Labs and Microsoft Visual Studio
 exceeded 5%.  Microsoft Developer ranked third highest with a 3.6% ratio.  Over the Feb 2012-March 2014, the average ratio of PTAT to Likes for the sample 
 pages was as follows:</p>
 <ul><li>Walmart 1.6%</li>
<li>Xbox 1.8%</li>
<li>Microsoft 1.9% </li>
<li>Johnson's Baby .4% </li>
<li>GE Appliances .7%</li></ul> </p>
<p>The PTAT metric is being replaced with new metrics.  One is "People Engaged", which is the number of unique people who've clicked, liked, commented on or 
shared a page's posts in the past 28 days.  The other is "Other Page Activity", which includes Page mentions, check-ins and posts by other people on the Page. 
 These metrics are being reported to page administrators and are not yet available to the public via Facebook's API.</p>
<h3>Annual Posts per Page</h3>
<p>Walmart and Microsoft lead in the number of posts on their pages.  GE and JNJ posting is relatively light.  JNJ's low level of posts could be because it has
 spread its activity onto its products pages.</p>

<h3>Post Popularity - Average "Likes" per Post</h3>
<p>Walmart and Xbox are the leaders in "likes" per post.  These figures, being averages, can be distorted by a few comments with a large number of "likes".  
There are 11 posts with over 100,000 "likes".  Eight of those posts came from Walmart and two came from Xbox.</p>  
<a href="http://www.digitaltrendanalytics.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/LikespPost.jpeg"><img class="displayed" src="http://www.digitaltrendanalytics.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/LikespPost.jpeg" width="710" height="550" /></a>
<p>Excluding Walmart and Microsoft, the chart below is a better view of 'likes' per post for the other pages.  Microsoft pages, even excluding the main "Microsoft"
page, lead in the number of 'likes' per post.</p>
<a href="http://www.digitaltrendanalytics.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/LikespPostMod.jpeg"><img class="displayed" src="http://www.digitaltrendanalytics.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/LikespPostMod.jpeg" width="710" height="550" /></a>
<p>Posts often have a large number of "likes" and "shares" because the post solicits them.  For example, in this data set, Walmart posted on July 4th, 
"Happy Fourth of July! 'Like' if you’re excited to celebrate our country."
The result was roughly 166,000 "likes".  Similarly Walmart posted, "Military heroes include soldiers and their spouses. Today is Military Spouse Day. Say 
'thank you' by clicking 'Like', and 'Share' to tell your friends."</p>
<h3>Post Popularity - Average Shares per Post</h3>
The high number of shares and comments on Johnson's Baby Products page could indicate that this consumer group wants to engage via Facebook.  Posts on IBM's pages
result in a low level of engagement, as well as low level of "likes".  Very little engagement occurs on Walmart's store pages. For all companies, enterprise 
products have less engagement than consumer products.

<h3>Post Popularity - Average Comments per Post</h3>
<p>Posts on the pages of Walmart, Xbox, Microsoft and Skype get the most comments on average.</p>

<h3>Conclusions</h3>
<p>This analysis examines some of the basic metrics for looking at Facebook engagement.  These metrics show a significantly higher level of engagement on the 
part of Walmart and Microsoft versus the other companies.  Walmart's activity is funneled through its main page, while Microsoft has active segments for its
various product lines.  There is not enough information here to assess which companies are
engaging well and which are not.  To do this, all company pages should be examined, both at the product level and internationally. Comparing data 
among peer companies and products is crucial. With more information, stronger conclusions can be made.   In an upcoming post I'll compare Johnson & Johnson's 
Facebook activity with that of Procter & Gamble.  Similarly I'll compare GE Appliances to Whirlpool/Maytag.  I'll also be combing through the comments on 
Walmart's page.  </p>

<p><em>Pages excluded from data set include:<ul>
<li>Active country pages for Microsoft, Walmart, IBM,  and GE (ex: IBM Japan).  Revenues from outside the US are material for all of these companies, so a full 
social media analysis of a company would need to include these pages.  </li>
<li>Many product pages were excluded.  Johnson & Johnson, for example, has a large consumer division and specific pages for products such as Listerene, 
Benedryl, Visine, etc. are not included but larger brands such as Johnson's Baby Products are included.  Similarly product pages for pharmaceutical drugs are 
not included.  A full analysis of Johnson & Johnson's Facebook strategy would need to include these pages, particularly because consumers often aren't aware
of the company behind a brand or product. </li>  
<li>Pages with a very low level of activity.</li>
<li>Microsofts MSN pages.</li>
